To Fix:
-Players spawning where they are as spectator?
-Changing captain model (as far as I know) to a custom model crashes the game.
-Scoreboard doesn't display long names properly
-Occasional script error when opening scoreboard (invalid player object?)
-Hidden seems to be able to be picked again when selecting a new one.
